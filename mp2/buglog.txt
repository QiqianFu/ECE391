1. didn't change registers in mode_X_CRTC, which is used for splitting two screen 

2. didn't spare enough space for screen bar 

3. print the backgroud twice for room name and command, only print background once can solve this problem

4. didn't notice the VGA only need 1/4 space for storing pixels information

5. the VGA mode has double buffer framework, I overlooked that

6. Overlook that A<<2 don't change A, but A<<=2 can

7. Forget to reset button to 0 since the command has been done

8. Didn't check whether the tux command is ABC or others, since ABC can't be continuous
